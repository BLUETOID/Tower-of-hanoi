SEO & Publishing checklist for Tower of Hanoi demo

1) Replace placeholder URLs
   - Search and replace `https://example.com/` in `index.html`, `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml` with your production domain.

2) Verify Meta Tags
   - `title` and `meta description` are set in `index.html`. Adjust to target desired keywords such as "Tower of Hanoi animation", "algorithm visualization", "C++ Tower of Hanoi".

3) Add og-image
   - Replace `og-image.png` placeholder with a screenshot image at `https://yourdomain/og-image.png` and update `index.html` meta tags.

4) Upload files to web host
   - Upload all files in the project root (including `sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt`, `manifest.json`, and `favicon.svg`).

5) Submit sitemap to Google Search Console
   - Add your site to Google Search Console, then submit `/sitemap.xml`.

6) Test structured data
   - Use Google Rich Results Test / Schema Markup Validator on your site URL.

7) Optional improvements
   - Add separate pages with articles: "How Tower of Hanoi works", "C++ implementation explained", "Interactive puzzles" to target more keywords.
   - Add canonical tags if you host multiple pages with similar content.

8) Monitoring & analytics
   - Add Google Analytics / consent banner if needed (not included by default).

9) Accessibility & Performance
   - Run Lighthouse and fix accessibility and performance issues (minify assets, compress images).

If you give me your production domain (e.g., `https://example.com`), I can replace the placeholders and generate a ready-to-upload `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` with your domain already set.
